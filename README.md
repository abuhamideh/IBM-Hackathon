## Features

- Database to store user information and their money
- Stock Plotter -  pulls the last 7 days of data from a stock specified by the user.
- InvestiGraph - game that allows users to invest their fake money into real stocks.
- IBM Chatbot that gives advice on types of investment accounts, tips for InvestiGraph and what stocks to invest in.




## Roadmap

- Allow for user to input a start and end date for Stock Plotter.

- Deploy the project so that anyone can access it (through Docker?)

- Modify the output for InvestiGraph so that data is displayed in a nicer way than alerts.

- Create skynet :)


## Impact

The impact of our project is revolutionising the way people look at investing. It intends to break down the difficulty barrier investing has so that the average person can easily learn and apply key concepts without any actual risk to their money.
